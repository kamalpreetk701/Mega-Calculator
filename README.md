# Mega-Calculator

It is the calculator for extremely large integers like containing 25-30 digits.
It stores the results in accumulator,performs addition,subtraction,multiplication,division on large numbers.

It can also calculate factorial and hailstone of a number.

Project contains 5 files:-MegaInt.h ,MegaCalc.h,Source.cpp,MegaCalc.cpp,MegaInt.cpp

Steps to run:-
Mega Calculator start by running source.cpp file.

Commands:-
1. any of (+,-,*,/,%) performed by command eg:-+1234567788 here operation is subtraction and sign is+,if command
is -123456 then it means sign is positive and operation is subtraction.Same for all other operations.

2.f- this command calculates the factorial of number in the accumulator.

3.h-this command calculates the hailstone of number in the accumulator.

4.n-negates the number in accumulator.

5.c-sets the accumulator to zero.

6.=-sets the accumultor to given operand. eg:=1234566 ,now accumulator is 1234566.
